## Overview
With a group we are supposed to create a working application/website using at least 2 third parties AP, along with using a third party CSS framework & styling. We are to work together and deligate tasks and update workflow using git-hubs branches and merging capabilities. 

## Run down
to make an appliction that will give nearest brewery location and information (brewery name web address etc.) by user zip code, also display location on map to display application results.

## app functionality
to make the website more dynamic we have implmented a drop-down menu so the user can specify which criteria best suits for desired search. User must enter at least one choice to run the script, the script will run when a user selects criteria then desired zip code and clicks "search button" the search functionalty will get real time information       using the brewery API database, it will display breweries by zipcode along with brewery information. This is also where our 2nd third party API starts to function, in this case mapbox API is used to display map with with breweries.
